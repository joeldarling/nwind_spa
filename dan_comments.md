Some notes:

Great work with the README, was simple and easy to understand

Nice job initially binding form data to the controller with ng-model. Where are your moveTaskUp/Down functions? Those I imagine will alter the priority bound to that task. For ordering, read into ng-repeat and see if you can learn about how to order items within it.

Keep it up!
